and so on.

## Versions

## Resources
OSCA Hub was originally created as a final project for CSCI 313 (Human Computer
Interaction). When the founding group began development on it, we conducted a series of user
surveys/tests and recorded a lot of useful feedback on its implementation and
possible new features. Below is a list of these findings for future reference:
