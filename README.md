## About
OSCA Hub is a website built for Oberlin's dining co ops, intended to facilitate
everyday communication by giving students the means to...
* find contact information
* publish live announcements
* post meal menus
* view workcharts and save plates
* submit sub requests

and so on.

## Versions
This is `oscahub-v3`, in which we are attempting to add some backend functionality
to the site. You can find the deployed site at [oscahub.herokuapp.com](http://oscahub.herokuapp.com).

`oscahub-v1` and `-v2` were created by Hayley Drapkin, Rosie Kerwin, Kendra Lockard,
Natalie Mattson, Sophie Shalit, and Cece Tannous-Taylor.
